The test project will consist of doing some basic backend routing using node and/or any complementary framework of your choice. Create an HTTP REST JSON API according to the following specifications and store the data in a mongodb database.

## Specs  
- You are building an online pizza builder where anonymous users can create and order pizzas with different toppings using a json rest api.
- Each pizza is a a subdocument of an "order" document in the db 
- Each order contains  information about the anonymous user who ordered the pizza (such as ip address, approx location / city? / etc...) and when it was ordered, and its delivery status. ( 0 - pending, 1- baking, 2 - delivering, 3 - delivered), add more data to order as you see fit.
- Each pizza has a list of ingredients, crust type, etc.. figure out your own pizza ingredients and pizza type from pizza recipes online eg [https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a24893663/homemade-pizza-recipe/](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a24893663/homemade-pizza-recipe/)

**YOU CAN USE POSTMAN TO HELP YOU TEST AND DEBUG YOUR API**
